    "description": "# Idea

Display name of structures on world.

### Rationale

Many steps in the inspection process refers to the name of the structure (mission plan, selection, reports). It is often needed to have a look on a map to determine where is the structure.

### Scope

Add a name label to the structure (option to display it or not). The line/network name should also be displayed.

### Expected result

(Paste any mockups, diagrams, or white board drawing of the idea)

index.js?1332:2177 Warning: React does not recognize the \`hoverColor\` prop on a DOM element. If you intentionally want it to appear in the DOM as a custom attribute, spell it as lowercase \`hovercolor\` instead. If you accidentally passed it from a parent component, remove it from the DOM element.

    "description": "## Description

Les infos géographiques d'un départ doivent pouvoir être affichée de manière logique, sans traiter le lidar différemment de la ligne, obstacles, pylônes etc.

## Problem

Aujourd'hui on traite différemment le lidar que la ligne, les pylônes, les obstacles etc.

## Solution

Le lidar doit devenir un switch button comme l'est aujourd'hui la ligne et les pylônes. Par défaut aucun départ n'est donc affiché sur la carte.
Un menu de sélection permet de sélectionner les départs qu'on souhaite afficher. Pour chaque départ sélectionné, on affiche par défaut son lidar, sa ligne, ses pylônes.

## Subtasks

  *  [  ] S'assurer que tous les départs sont bien rentrés proprement (lignes et lidar dans des structures différentes)
  *  [  ] Ne faire apparaitre les boutons ligne, lidar, pylônes, obstacles que si un départ n'a été sélectionné",

Create a way to get the length of inspected network in a mission (hta mostly ?). 

We need to traverse the links of between the structures in order to recreate the network layout.
